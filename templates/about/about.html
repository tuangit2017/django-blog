Project Topic is creating a Website blog using the development Django/Framework. Also, we write a scripts
to import csv files holing information of movies database to display the chart. The script require using Matplotlib library.
</h5>

<h2 class="text-danger">Python/Django Framework</h2>
<p>Before we can use Django, we have to install it. The system require to have python install first.
You can search how to download python and install it. After you install python, there is a lightweight database
called SQLite includes. It's better to get the latest version of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or 
with your operating systemâ€™s package manager.</p>
<p>You can verify that Python is installed by typing python from your shell; you should see the version of python installed.</p>
<p>To verify that Django can be seen by Python, type python from your shell. Then at the Python prompt, try to import Django,
then print(django.get_version()).</p>

<h2 class="text-danger">Python and Data Science</h2>
<p>Project idea will be perform analysis of movies released in the cinema between 2000 and 2019
  where we use an API to interface with IMDB and get practice with plotting and data visualizations
  using modules such as matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn. We also build an website using Django framework
  to display the result as well as information of the projects
</p>
<h2 class="text-danger">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Internet Movie Database (IMDb) is a website that serves as an online database of world cinema.
  This website contains a large number of public data on films such as the title of the film, the year of release
  of the film, the genre of the film, the audience, the rating of critics, the duration of the film, the summary of
  the film, actors, directors and much more. Faced with the large amount of data available on this site, so, it would
  be interesting to analyze the movies data on the IMDb website between the year 2000 and the year 2019.
</p>

<h2 class="text-danger">Target</h2>
<p>The team should do prepare to collect the data from online, this step may take a long time if the data is not
  available as a CSV file. Then, after the dataset is ready, we will explore the data and analyze it.
  Once this step is done, we will model the data, adapt and validate it. During this phase, we should start
  making questions and trying to predict from the information we got. As I said before, in this study of IMDb,
  Once the data modeling is complete, the last step is to visualize the results and display the images on the
  website.
</p>
<p>In fact, the purpose of Data Scientist is primarily to make the data talk, to make sense of the data from a
  large volume of structured or unstructured data, collected or scattered, internal or external, to bring out
  the useful information that will bring added value in for example a business in order to increase the
   turnover of a company.
